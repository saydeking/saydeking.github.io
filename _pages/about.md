Welcome! I'm Sayde (pronounced shaw-day), a Ph.D. Candidate under the advisement of [Dr. Tempestt Neal](https://tempestt-neal.github.io/web/) in the [Cyber Identity and Behavior Research (CIBeR) Lab](https://tempestt-neal.github.io/web/research.html#team) at the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/engineering/cse/). My research interests include behavioral analysis, human-computer interaction, and applied machine learning. I am a [Florida Education Fund McKnight Dissertation Fellow](https://www.fefonline.org/df.html), an [Alfred P. Sloan Minority Ph.D. Scholar](https://www.nacme.org/engage-graduate), and [National GEM Consortium Fellow](https://www.gemfellowship.org/gem-fellowship-program/).

**My research**
===
Following a user-centered approach, I leverage qualitative and experimental research methods to investigate topics related to the use of artificial intelligence in mental health settings. Specifically, my Ph.D. studies explore the use of artificial intelligence to detect deception in topics related to one's mental well-being.
