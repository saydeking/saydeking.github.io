Thrilled to be at the Air Force Research Laboratory in the 711th Human Performance Wing as a National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine National Research Council Postdoctoral Research Associate. During my tenure at the AFRL, I will work on projects aimed at learning about elements of human-computer interaction, ML/AI/LLM explainability and tranparency regarding trust. Looking forward to these next couple of years!
