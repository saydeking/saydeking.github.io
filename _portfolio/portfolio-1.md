My dissertation work is comprised of multiple ongoing studies. We recently recruited 45 individuals aged 18-25 years old and 15 individuals aged 30 years and older for data collection. 
Each participant completed a total of three video-recorded mock interviews covering the following topics: biographical background, student success or job satisfaction, and mental well-being. We extract video, audio, gaze, and physiological cues from video recordings and data collected from an Empatica E4 wrist-worn wearable. These data are leveraged to assess deception detection performance in cross-domain and cross-demographic scenarios. 

Currently, we are conducting focus groups with mental health clinicians to inform the safe and ethical integration of AI-enabled deception detection technologies in therapeutic contexts. [Click here](https://usf.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3sYYRG4piad60VU) to take our screening survey!
