This interdisciplinary project includes the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering and Mental Health Law and Policy at the University of South Florida. This study explores the feasibility of a group-based, peer-led intervention for college students experiencing feelings of shame and nervousness regarding mental health challenges they face. The computing side of the project aims to corroborate self-reported measures of mental well-being by developing AI models using smartphone sensing behaviors collected from intervention participants.
